                        <p>Current Projects:<br/>
                        <u>Project#1</u>: The goal of this project is to provide consumers(cerner millennium teams) various services, API's which serves them to perform 
                        Read, Write, Update, Delete on the Clinical Event Model. This Clinical Event Data model is responsible for holding almost 50% of EHR information such as testing, treatment
                        and diagnostic events that are stored as clinical events. Millennium solutions teams request EHR information from this clinical event model and there are many ways the clinicians
                        can view the data. Our team provides many Java services and API's to support the different ways the clinicians requests for the result data.
                        Overall, I'm a senior engineer on this millennium backend services team who is responsible for developing the enterprise java services and API's efficiently and safely. 
                        The Tech stack we use to develop the services are Java8, Enterprise Java service(EJS), JDBC, Hibernate, SQL, Google Guice and cucumber for integration tests. 
                        <br/>
                        <u>Project#2</u>: This project focuses on improving the scalability of the Cerner Millennium System.
                        The Goal of the project is to reduce the Oracle usage and the cost by moving clinical documents(BLOB Data) from Oracle Clinical tables to AWS Simple Storage Service(S3).
                        Working on developing JAVA, CCL(Cerner Command Language), Rest Service API's for consumers being Cerner Millennium Teams.
                        These api's help Cerner Millennium teams to read, write, update and delete clinical documents data from AWS S3 with no need of AWS S3 implementation or knowledge.
                        Technologies used to develop api's include Java8, AWS S3 SDK, JDBC, SQL, Google Guice, CCL.
                        Also gained experience working on setting up global AWS S3 configurations for Cerner clients.
